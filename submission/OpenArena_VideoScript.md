## 0:00 - 0:20: The Problem (The "Benchmark Saturation" Glitch)

**[Visual]**: Screen recording of a generic "Leaderboard" scrolling infinitely. The numbers "99.9%" start multiplying and covering the screen until it looks broken.
**[Audio]**: "We are in a crisis of measurement. GPT-4, Gemini, Claude—they all ace the benchmarks. 90% on GSM8K. 95% on MMLU. But ask them to code a novel app, or reason through a new paradox, and they hallucinate."

**[Visual]**: Text slam: **GOODHART'S LAW**.
**[Audio]**: "When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure. Static benchmarks are dead. They've been leaked, memorized, and gamed."

---

## 0:20 - 0:50: The Solution (Enter OpenArena)

**[Visual]**: A dark screen. A single prompt appears: `> INIT_OPEN_ARENA`.
**[Visual]**: A map of nodes (Validators and Miners) lighting up.
**[Audio]**: "Introducing OpenArena. The first decentralized, adversarial evaluation protocol on Bittensor."

**[Visual]**: Split screen.

- Left ("Old Way"): A teacher handling out the same test every year.
- Right ("OpenArena"): A sparring algorithm generating new moves every second.
  **[Audio]**: "In OpenArena, there is no static test set. Validators generate _fresh_, verified tasks every single epoch. Math puzzles. Code generation. Logic traps. Unseen. Un-memorizable."

## 0:50 - 1:10: How It Works (The Mechanics)

**[Visual]**: Diagram of the **Commit-Reveal** flow.

1. Info graphic: `Task -> Miner -> Hash(Answer)`.
2. A "Lock" icon appears.
3. Timer counts down.
4. `Reveal -> Score`.
   **[Audio]**: "Miners must solve these tasks instantly to prove _Generalization_, not memorization. We use a cryptographically secure Commit-Reveal scheme to prevent front-running, and a Brier-Score based calibration metric to punish hallucinations."

## 1:10 - 1:30: The Unfair Advantage (KaggleIngest)

**[Visual]**: The **KaggleIngest** Dashboard (Sleek, Dark Mode). Cursor clicks "Submit Model".
**[Audio]**: "But technology is nothing without distribution. We are leveraging **KaggleIngest** to onboard the 15 million data scientists from Kaggle directly into this arena."

**[Visual]**: Numbers ticking up: "Miners: 10... 100... 10,000".
**[Audio]**: "The world's best talent, competing to define the true 'Smartest Model'."

## 1:30 - 1:40: Call to Action

**[Visual]**: OpenArena Logo using the generated Neo-Brutalist assets.
**[Text]**: **THE PROOF OF INTELLIGENCE**.
**[Audio]**: "Static benchmarks are the past. Adversarial evaluation is the future. Join the Arena."

**[End Card]**: Github URL | Bittensor Ideathon Logo.
