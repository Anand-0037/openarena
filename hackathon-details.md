# Bittensor Subnet Ideathon: The Ultimate Guide (OpenArena Edition)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Strategic Pivot**: We are now fully committed to **OpenArena**, leveraging your KaggleIngest background to solve the AI Benchmark Crisis. This document contains everything you need to win.

## 1. The Strategy: Why OpenArena Wins

### 🧠 The Core Thesis

Static benchmarks (GSM8K, MMLU) are dead because models memorize them.
**OpenArena** is the "Continuous Kaggle":

- **Validators** generate _fresh_, unseen tasks every epoch.
- **Miners** must generalize instantly.
- **Proof of Intelligence** = Ability to adapt to new entropy, not recite old data.

### 🛡️ Mechanism Design (The "Heart")

- **Scoring**: $S = \text{Accuracy} \times \text{Calibration} - \text{Latency}$.
- **Anti-Gaming**: Commit-Reveal scheme prevents front-running.
- **Business Model**: AI Labs pay TAO to stress-test their models against our "Red Team" validators.

| **Round I: Ideathon**   | Dec 23, 2025 | Feb 28, 2026 | **Design Phase**. Deliver a PDF Proposal + Video. |
| **Round II: Hackathon** | Mar 2, 2026  | Mar 30, 2026 | **Execution Phase**. Implement on Testnet.        |

### 📝 Submission Breakdown (Round I)

1.  **OpenArena Whitepaper** (PDF):
    - **Thesis**: "The End of Static Benchmarks."
    - **Math**: The Generalization Score function.
    - **Architecture**: Miner/Validator Commit-Reveal flow.
2.  **Video**: Show the "Live Leaderboard" (powered by KaggleIngest).
3.  **Deck**: 10 slides on the $10B Evaluation Market.

## 3. Execution Roadmap (Round II)

### The "Golden Path" MVP

If selected for Round II, build **only** this loop:

1.  **Validator**: Generates a random math/logic puzzle -> Encrypts Ground Truth.
2.  **Miner**: Solves -> Commits Hash -> Reveals Solution.
3.  **UI**: KaggleIngest dashboard showing live "Generalization Scores."

> [!TIP]
> **Adversarial Hardening**: The key to winning is proving you can't be cheated. We will emphasize the **Cryptographic Commit-Reveal** protection in all documentation.
