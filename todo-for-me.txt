1. 🎥 Record and Upload the Videos (Critical Missing Piece)


The HackQuest portal specifically highlights: "Please Upload Demo Video" and you need the 5-10 minute explanation video required by the Ideathon.

Action: Open

deliverables/video_script.md
 (or

openarena-video-script.md
).
Action: Record yourself presenting the pitch deck and doing a screen-share walkthrough of the

demo.py
 terminal output and

dashboard.html
 to prove the concept works.
Action: Upload the video to YouTube (Unlisted) or Vimeo, and paste the link into the "Demo Video" and/or "Pitch Video" fields on HackQuest.
2. 📤 Convert and Upload Documents
The Ideathon requires the Proposal and Pitch Deck in PDF, Slides, Notion, or as a GitHub repo. You have all these written in Markdown.

The Pitch Deck: Convert

deliverables/pitch_deck.md
 into a 10-slide PDF or Google Slides presentation. Upload this to the HackQuest platform.
The Whitepaper/Proposal: Convert

WHITE_PAPER.md
 and/or

openarena-proposal.md
 into a clean PDF or Notion document and link it in the submission.
3. 🐦 Publish the Public Introduction Post
The rules state: "Short public introduction of the subnet idea on X (Twitter) or other public platforms."

Action: Open

deliverables/social_thread.md
.
Action: Post this thread on Twitter/X, tagging the relevant Bittensor accounts if specified.
Action: Copy the URL of your published tweet and ensure it is included somewhere in your HackQuest submission or project description.
4. 💻 Publish the GitHub Repository
Having the code public adds massive credibility and satisfies the "GitHub repository" format option for the proposal.

Action: You already have your .git initialized locally. Commit all your finalized files (

INCENTIVE_MECHANISM.md
,

demo.py
,

dashboard.html
, the openarena/ modules, etc.).
Action: Push it to a public GitHub repository named OpenArena.
Action: Add the GitHub repository link to the HackQuest project page.
5. 🖼️ Finalize the HackQuest Project Page
You have your text ready, just make sure the fields are maximally polished:

Logo: Upload

openarena_logo.png
 as the project logo.
Project Description: Paste the Markdown exactly as you have it in your prompt (The Problem, The Solution, The Unfair Advantage, Tech Stack).
Fundraising Status: Keep it as "Not funded / Bootstrapped" just like you have it.
