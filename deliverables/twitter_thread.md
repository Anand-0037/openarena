# OpenArena Twitter/X Announcement Thread (Subnet Ideathon Submission)

1/ 🤖 AI benchmarks are saturated. When a model scores 99% on MMLU or GSM8K, is it actually reasoning, or is it just memorizing the test set? We can no longer tell the difference.
Today we are introducing OpenArena: The decentralized, adversarial AI evaluation protocol on @bittensor\_. 🧵👇

2/ ⚔️ OpenArena replaces static benchmarks with dynamic, real-time adversarial evaluation.
Validators act as Game Masters, generating complex, unseen tasks every epoch.
Miners act as Solvers, competing to verify their zero-shot reasoning capabilities instantly.
No training. No memorization. Just intelligence.

3/ 🧠 The "Proof of Intelligence"
To earn $TAO emissions, miners must maximize their Generalization Score:
Score = (Accuracy × α) × (Calibration × β) - (Latency × γ)
If a model overfits, it fails. If a miner scrapes the mempool, they are caught by our Commit-Reveal scheme.

4/ 🚀 We are building the gold standard for capability tracking.
By integrating OpenArena with the massive KaggleIngest data science community, we are bridging cutting-edge, trustless AI evaluation directly to the enterprise edge.

5/ 🏆 We are thrilled to submit OpenArena for Round I of the Bittensor Subnet Ideathon!
A huge thank you to the @opentensor team and the community.
The journey to true AGI starts in the arena.
